# ü§ñ IntelliBot: A Rule-Based Chatbot Using Python

## üìå Project Title
**Task 8: Build a Chatbot Using If-Else (Rule-Based Chatbot)**

---

## üß† Description

**IntelliBot** is a basic chatbot developed as part of an internship project focused on understanding the foundational structure of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot uses simple `if-elif-else` conditional logic to provide text-based replies to user inputs. It simulates a structured conversation without any use of artificial intelligence or external libraries.

This project demonstrates how early chatbots were built before the introduction of advanced NLP models. It also helps understand how logical rules can control program behavior based on user input.

## üéØ Objective

The objective of this project is to:
- Understand the basic structure of NLP through a rule-based system.
- Create a chatbot using only Python and conditional statements.
- Simulate user interaction by mapping inputs to predefined outputs.
- Gain hands-on experience with control flow and text handling in Python.

| what is your name      | I am IntelliBot, designed for structured conversation.            |
| what is ai             | AI stands for Artificial Intelligence ‚Äî machines that think.      |
| who created you        | I was created by a curious intern using Python and simple logic!  |
| tell me a fact         | The first computer bug was a real moth found in 1947.             |
| thank you              | You‚Äôre welcome. Always ready to help.                             |
| [any unknown text]     | Sorry, I don't recognize that input. Try something else.          |
| exit                   | Session ended. Goodbye!                                           |
